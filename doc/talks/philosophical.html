        <h3>Emerging Challenges</h3>
          <p>
            Microelectronics industry:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Proliferation of on-chip micro-controllers</li>
            <li>More semiconductor designs rely on firmware</li>
            <li>Co-design of hardware alongside embedded, low-level software</li>
          </ul>
          <br/>
          <p>
            These trends are driven by market competition and engineering advantages:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Extracting complex control to firmware adds flexibility and survivability of products</li>
            <li>Shifting work to micro-controllers can increase scalability</li>
          </ul>
          <br/>
          <p>
            Firmware is not just exciting; it is also worrying.

            <ul>
              <li>Different languages are processed by different tool chains</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Nonstandard hardware-specific I/O primitives and concurrency semantics</li>
            <ul>

        <h3>Emerging Challenges - Automated Verification</h3>
          <p>
            At FMCAD, audience's interests and priorities vary.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>
            Cannot ignore hardware/software interfaces:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Too many false alarms due to nondeterminism</li>
            <li>Too few bugs (unsoundness) due to side effects</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Research opportunities:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>I/O is subject to hardware-specific protocol rules (particularly important for new projects)</li>
            <li>Hardware (physical world) is common source of concurrency</li>
            <li><b>But what are technical details of the problems?</b></li>

        <h3>Paper</h3>
          <p>
            Show the challenges and feasibility of semi-automatically finding bugs in the
            interactions at hardware/software interfaces before a cycle-accurate model
            of the hardware is available

          <!--<ul>
            <li>
              Expose violations of hardware-specific pre- and post-conditions (properties)

            <ul>

        <h3>TMP105 Characteristics</h3>
          <p>
            Things to think about:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>There are four external registers of different sizes.</li>
            <li>Most are readable and writable (rw), but at least one is read-only.</li>
            <li>However, at least one bit of a rw-register is write-only.</li>
            <li>Temperature measurements can be continuous or not (shutdown mode).</li>
            <li>&hellip;</li>
          </ul>

        <h3>TMP105 Properties</h3>
          <p>
            Encode properties as runtime assertions in executable hardware model:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                At most two bytes can be read or written of the temperature threshold registers.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Exactly one configuration byte can be read or written.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Each read of the temperature register is preceded by a write of
                a 1 to the MSB of the configuration register if and only if its
                LSB is a 1 (i.e. shutdown mode).
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                But when the MSB of the configuration register is read, it is zero
                regardless of any previous writes to it.
              </p>
            </li>

        <h3>ETHOC Characteristics</h3>
          <p>
            Things to think about:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Incoming Ethernet frames (RX) arrive continuously.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>An adequate model of concurrency is important.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Software and hardware communicate through DMA buffer descriptors.</li>
            <li>Driver supports polling and interrupt mode.</li>
            <li>Hardware always sets interrupt status flags.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Thus, interrupt sources must be cleared before switching to interrupt mode.</li>
              <li>Otherwise, when RX interrupt source is re-enabled, a spurious interrupt could occur.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>&hellip;</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Code is good exemplar for concurrency bugs due to interrupts in producer-consumer cases.</p>

          <p>We found the fix in the <a href="http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=20f70ddd6558a39a89dba4af675686c5a8dbd7b3" target="_blank">Linux 2.6.38 kernel</a> release.</p>

        <h3>ETHOC Properties</h3>
          <p>Expose concurrency bug:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              When the software enables the MAC receiver, there exists at least one empty RX buffer descriptor.
            </li>
            <li>
              The software must eventually process every RX frame. At the very latest, when it is stopped, all RX frames must have been processed.
            </li>
          </ul>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h3>Limitations</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Manual extraction and slicing
            </li>
            <li>
              No support for nested interrupts
            </li>
            <li>
              Often prohibitively large partial order concurrency encoding (20+ GiB)
            </li>
