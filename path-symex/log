Remarks (Mid April 2014):

The majority of benchmarks with KLEE were run on machine dkr12. I had to switch
to drk11 for "sum-recursive" and "counter", however, because someone else started
to heavily use dkr12 in the middle of the experiments.

For KLEE, the following types of commands were run:

  $ llvm-gcc --emit-llvm -I ../../klee/include -D ENABLE_KLEE -D N=46 -std=c99 -c -g sum-recursive-safe.c
  $ time klee -no-output -search=dfs -exit-on-error sum-recursive-safe.o

All times correspond to "Elapsed time" as recorded by KLEE in its "info" file.
As a sanity check, I have compared one of these times with the result of the
"time" command on Linux, OK.

Contrary to conventional wisdom, benchmark modulus-unsafe.c shows that symbolic
execution can be much slower at finding a bug than proving program correctness.
This is confirmed by the safe and unsafe "sum-recursive" benchmark where only the
assertion is changed (== versus !=).

If N is increased to eight (8) for insertion-sort/safe, then KLEE does not
produce results within 45 minutes.

For CBMC's path-symex tool, the following type of command was run:

  $ symex -D N=2000 -D ENABLE_CPROVER modulus-safe.c

When necessary "--unwind" was specified (see table).

To avoid the overhead of file I/O, the output program statements in
path_symex.cpp were disabled by modifying the source code.

Both modulus-safe.c and modulus-unsafe.c gave the following errors with
symex after around 3 minutes:

  terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::bad_alloc'
    what():  std::bad_alloc
  Aborted (core dumped)

For these two benchmarks, I confirmed that decreasing N=1740
gives the right results within around 2 minutes. The error
starts to occur when N<=1745.

Both bst-safe.c and bst-unsafe.c result in "failed to dereference `symbol'".

merge-sort-unsafe.c and sum-recursive-unsafe.c complete in less than one
second but the result is likely unjustified given that path-symex gives
the wrong result for the corresponding safe benchmarks.
